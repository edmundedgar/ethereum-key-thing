This is a simple script make Ethereum addresses on an offline computers.

This is intended to be very simple, without all the key password bureaucracy found in parity and get. In general that bureaucracy is there to protect you, so you probably shouldn't be using this.

I made this for myself, I haven't thought very hard about documenting it so that other people can use it without all their stuff getting hacked.

Hopefully you can make a secure key, but maybe not, who knows. YMMV.
